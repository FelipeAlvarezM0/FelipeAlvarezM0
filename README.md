## Felipe Alvarez — Backend Integration & Reliability Engineer

I build backend systems that must not fail.

My work focuses on transactional environments where errors have real-world impact: payments, fiscal documents, distributed retail operations and third-party integrations.  
I specialize in stabilizing unreliable systems, preventing data loss and ensuring consistency across services.

---

### What I Actually Do

- Design resilient integration services
- Prevent duplicate transactions using idempotency strategies
- Implement retry & recovery mechanisms for unstable networks
- Debug production failures in live environments
- Modernize legacy systems without downtime
- Reconcile data with external/gov APIs
- Build services that continue operating offline

---

### Typical Problems I Solve

- “The API sometimes responds, sometimes not”
- “Invoices duplicated in production”
- “Data inconsistent between systems”
- “Sales stop when internet drops”
- “Legacy code nobody understands”
- “System works… until real users use it”

---

### Technologies I Use

**Backend**
- Java / Kotlin / C#
- REST & SOAP integrations
- Authentication flows & tokens
- API versioning & contract validation

**Data**
- SQL Server / relational databases
- Transaction consistency
- Data reconciliation
- JSON / XML transformation

**Reliability**
- Retry strategies
- Offline queueing
- Idempotent operations
- Failure recovery
- Production debugging

### What You Won’t Find Here
UI experiments, tutorial projects or clone apps.  
Most repositories here exist to solve real operational problems.

---

### Currently Interested In
Backend roles involving:
- Integrations
- Distributed systems
- Fintech / payments
- High availability services
- System reliability
